        <p>
          Life can be very interesting. I went to school for business admin with
          a concentration in project management, but my first job was in IT. I
          knew nothing about being a Salesforce Admin, but they hired me and
          allowed me to learn little by little how to admin the system. With my
          project management background, I was also familiar with Jira Software,
          so I ended up becoming an admin for that afterwards.

          The company opened a Project Specialist position, which I thought was
          my dream job, but after being in the position for a few months, I
          missed the Jira technical stuff so much and had so much stress, I left
          the company to become an Atlassian (Jira) Business consultant where I
          could mix my technical and business skills. However, it is hard to
          recommend certain soutions that require examining code or scripts
          without knowing how to code.

          After finishing the UNC Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, I am now
          prepared and have been using my coding skills to create apps, debug
          scripts, and be a better consultant.
